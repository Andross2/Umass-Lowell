Name: Chuong Vu
Class: Computing IV
Professor: Dr. Yelena Rykalova
Assignment: ps3a

Based on the online lecture from Fred Martin that he went through the lecture and explained about the homework. It made me have a better idea how to write the header and its functions to make the program run as homework. Pretty much I have explained anything through my code.
