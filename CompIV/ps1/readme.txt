Name: Chuong Vu
Class: Computing IV
Professor: Dr. Yelena Rykalova
Assignment: ps1

Based on the template that provided by professor Yelena, changed some and wrote functions that to draw Sierpinski?s Triangle recursive.  In the homework I have two difference codes. One is the sierpinski?s triangle that is required by the instructor and other is original code with is draw squares by my idea.  In sierpinski?s triangle, I draw three more triangle on it?s side and it will keep doing that base on the depth (how many time I want to do recursive). Same with sierpinski, my original code draw a squares and then other four squares on each it?s side.

In the code, I used virtual draw function for normal draw windows function; it will draw any shape based on depth and as many as how many times I want.

By using this recursive function, we save more memory since we only need one object for it recursive.

This assignment took me 3 days to finished.
